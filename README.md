# Image-Classification-Using-CNN
# Cat vs. Dog Image Classification using CNN

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of cats and dogs. By leveraging deep learning, the model automatically learns to distinguish between the two animals with high accuracy. This project serves as a practical introduction to image classification and the power of CNNs.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a robust image classification model capable of distinguishing between cats and dogs. Using a well-known dataset from Kaggle, a CNN is designed, trained, and evaluated to achieve this task. The project showcases a complete deep learning workflow, from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

  - **CNN Fundamentals**: Understand the architecture and function of Convolutional Neural Networks.
  - **Image Preprocessing**: Learn how to prepare image data for a deep learning model.
  - **Data Augmentation**: Implement techniques to enhance model generalization and prevent overfitting.
  - **Model Building**: Construct a deep learning model using TensorFlow and Keras.
  - **Performance Evaluation**: Analyze and interpret model performance using accuracy and loss metrics.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

  - **Python 3.x** 🐍
  - **TensorFlow & Keras**: The core libraries for building and training the CNN.
  - **NumPy**: For numerical operations and data manipulation.
  - **Matplotlib**: For plotting training and validation curves.
  - **ImageDataGenerator**: A Keras utility for efficient data loading and augmentation.

## 🔬 Methodology

1.  **Dataset Preparation**: Images from the Kaggle dataset are loaded, resized to a uniform dimension (e.g., 150x150 pixels), and normalized.
2.  **Data Augmentation**: Real-time data augmentation is applied to the training set using `ImageDataGenerator`, which includes techniques like rotation, zooming, and flipping.
3.  **Model Architecture**: A sequential CNN is built with multiple blocks of `Conv2D` and `MaxPooling2D` layers, followed by `Flatten` and `Dense` layers. The final layer uses a sigmoid activation for binary classification.
4.  **Model Training**: The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and `binary_crossentropy` loss function, then trained on the augmented dataset.
5.  **Evaluation**: Model performance is assessed on a separate validation set, and the results are visualized.

## 📈 Model Performance

  - **Training Accuracy**: \> 95%
  - **Validation Accuracy**: \> 90%
  - The model demonstrates consistent learning, with training loss decreasing and accuracy increasing over epochs.

## 💡 Solution

A custom CNN model is trained on a large dataset to learn the key features that differentiate cats and dogs. The model's architecture is optimized to efficiently extract spatial hierarchies of features, resulting in high classification accuracy and providing a robust, automated solution for this classification problem.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

  - **Transfer Learning**: Use a pre-trained model (e.g., VGG-16, ResNet50) as a feature extractor to achieve higher accuracy and faster convergence.
  - **Web Application**: Deploy the model using a framework like Flask or FastAPI to create a web application where users can upload an image for real-time classification.
  - **Advanced Architectures**: Experiment with more complex CNN architectures or hyperparameter tuning to further improve performance.

## 🎨 Sample Visualization

  - **Sample Predictions**: A grid of images with their predicted labels and confidence scores.
  - **Dataset Samples**: A few example images from the dataset to show the variety of data.
